# React + Vite

I created my own pet design project at my discretion (my goal was not design, but functionality).

Tools that were used to implement the project:
- React Hooks;
- React Router;
- Farmer motion for animation;
- Redux Toolkit (I made an imitation of the authorization page using the Redux Toolkit, but not fully).

  Css classes were used to style the project. Instead of css classes, you could also apply:
- Sass preprocessors,
- css modules (very popular in modern projects),
- Tailwind etc.

  Also, to demonstrate understanding and skills, the project was made Adaptive, using Media queries, for different types of screens.
