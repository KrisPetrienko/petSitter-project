# React + Vite Pet Project

This is my pet design project, created to demonstrate functionality rather than design. Below is a detailed overview of the tools and technologies used.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects.
- **React Router**: To implement navigation between pages.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Used to mimic an authorization page. (Note: Implementation is partial.)

## üé® Styling

The project is styled using **CSS classes**. Alternatively, the following styling methods could have been used:
- **Sass preprocessors**
- **CSS Modules** (widely used in modern projects)
- **Tailwind CSS**, etc.

### Responsive Design
To showcase adaptive skills, the project is fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes using **Media Queries**.
